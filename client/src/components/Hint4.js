			<h4>Suspects Interrogation</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Jacob:</b> He is the cleaner who found the body in the repair room.
				He has a past history of Robbery and burglary and was released from
				prison a few months ago and got a job as a cleaner for the event. Jacob
				and Roddy had a falling out that day when Roddy made continuous passing
				comments about his financial condition of Jacob and the color of his
				skin.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Interrogation:</b> Jacob found Roddy's body in one of the rooms while
				he was cleaning them. He has the keys to all the rooms to perform his
				duties. On the day of the incident, he arrived at work at 1 pm and
				started cleaning the place. At 2 pm, he argued with Roddy after Roddy
				made insensitive comments about Jacob's appearance while he was cleaning
				Roddy's room. Following the argument, Jacob went to a nearby café to
				cool off and have some coffee and refreshments (as food in Canteen was
				only available after 6PM). At 3 pm, he saw Angela, the teacher, and
				Samantha arguing at the café. Jacob could not understand what the
				argument was about, but he heard Angela say "I miss the days when we
				were roommates and you weren't married." He saw Angela threaten Samantha
				before leaving the café, and Samantha followed her out. Jacob returned
				to work from cafe at 4 pm and saw Gil in the Repairs Room working on his
				robot. Jacob's clothes had bloodstains, which he explained were due to
				Gil accidentally cutting his finger with a chainsaw and looking for a
				replacement. Jacob continued cleaning other rooms when the dance
				performance started. He believed that most people would be attending the
				dance event, and there wouldn't be anyone in the rooms.

				<b>Peter:</b> Peter was a 4th-year student currently studying ECE. He is
				23 years old and is part of the college team who would be participating
				in RoboRampage. But Peter was not serious about the event and had
				ulterior motives. Peter was involved in various drug-related crimes and
				had worked under Roddy before as a researcher for a few months. He was
				found drinking in the same proximity where Roddy was eventually found
				dead.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Interrogation:</b> Peter, a student of 4th Year, who is also
				Alcoholic and take drugs is not too good in Academics and was attending
				lectures on the day of the event. However, during his break time, he and
				Alice were caught making out by their professor, Angela. Despite being
				caught, Peter didn't deny the incident. He had met Alice while working
				as a researcher under Roddy, and they hit it off immediately and are
				dating since then. A practice session was held at 3 pm but since Angela
				was not present, Peter sneaked out and brought some alcohol for himself
				and Alice. Afterward, they went to the Repairs Room together at 5 pm,
				since no one would bother them there. At 6 pm, they both left the
				Repairs Room. Peter admits that he deactivated the alarm to avoid
				getting caught so that he and Alice could enjoy themselves.
