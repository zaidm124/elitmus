			<h4>Suspects Interrogation</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Gil:</b> The person who gains the most from the death of Roddy. Gil
				is Roddy's biggest rival. With years of history between them, Roddy had
				managed to win 3 consecutive events against Gil, who was always 2nd. Gil
				has a past record of Threatening and Aggravated assault. Hot-tempered
				and short-fused, he swears he hasnâ€™t committed the murder, yet shows no
				remorse. He is 6 feet tall, 42 years of age, and has a B.Tech from NIT
				Patna in ECE.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Interrogation:</b> During the investigation, it was discovered that
				Gil had harbored a lot of repressed emotions toward Roddy. Roddy had
				always belittled Gil, but he was also a source of motivation for him.
				Gil, however, never had any intention of killing Roddy. Gil arrived on
				campus at 2 pm and had some chips and coffee in the canteen. He noticed
				that Alice was pacing around anxiously. After that, he went to the
				Repairs Room and worked on his robot until 5 pm. He had brought various
				tools to make final adjustments to his robot, including a faulty
				chainsaw, which caused him to cut his finger. Jacob assisted him in
				cleaning the wound, and Gil wiped the chainsaw and other tools clean to
				remove any traces of his blood. At 5 pm, Gil left the Repairs Room and
				went to the practice arena, where he spent an hour testing his Robot. He
				attended the events that followed. He trusts Jacob and suspects Alice
				the most in this case.
			</p>

				<b>Samantha:</b> The wife of Roddy. She was a successful engineer, with
				a B.Tech in ECE from NIT Surat, until she married Roddy and was forced
				to quit her job. The marriage was arranged and she had to move from
				Surat to Mumbai with her husband. She has no known criminal record. When
				the death of her husband was announced, she broke down in tears and
				could not look at the body for more than 10 seconds. She was traveling
				with Roddy for the month-long event in Gujarat. She is 36 years of age
				and 5 feet 7 inches tall.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Interrogation:</b> Samantha didn't show up for the RoboRampage on the
				day of the event because she and her husband, Roddy, had a major fight.
				Their marriage was toxic, and Roddy had physically abused her, leaving
				visible bruises. Despite the abuse, Samantha couldn't divorce him due to
				family pressure. During the investigation, Samantha claimed that Roddy
				blamed her for his poor performance in events. When questioned about her
				absence during the time of the murder, Samantha had a valid alibi. CCTV
				footage showed that she was at home with her child after 4 pm. However,
				Jacob told investigators that he had seen Samantha and Angela together
				at the cafe, which Samantha confirmed, stating that they were just two
				old friends catching up. When asked about the argument, Samantha refused
				to elaborate, saying that she only wanted the best for her friend.
